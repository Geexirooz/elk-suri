# ELK-Suri
This docker-compose project will assist with setting up and creating a ELK stack (with no L for now) using self-signed TLS certificates.
This repo's idea comes from [this](https://github.com/swimlane/elk-tls-docker/tree/master) great repository

## Environment Details
This docker-compose project will create the following Elastic containers based on version 9.2.0:

* Elasticsearch
* Kibana

## Setup

In order to use this project, you must first include the following in a file named `.env`. I have provided an example environment variable file here [.env-example](https://github.com/swimlane/elk-tls-docker/blob/master/.env-example).

> Copy or create your own `.env` from the provided example or from the code block below

```text
ELK_VERSION=9.2.0

# Credentials
KIBANA_USERNAME=kibana_geexi
KIBANA_PASSWORD=some_password_for_kibana
SUPERUSER_USERNAME=geexirooz
SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=some_other_password

# URLs
KIBANA_URL=https://0.0.0.0:5601

# Configuration Variables
ELASTICSEARCH_HEAP=2g
XPACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY=somesuperlongstringlikethisoneMQBbtsynu4bV2uxLy

# Self signed TLS certificates
CA_DAYS=3650
ELASTIC_DIR=/usr/share/elasticsearch
KIBANA_DIR=/usr/share/kibana

# Suricata Configuration
SURICATA_VERSION=8.0.2
INTERFACE=eth0
SURICATA_DIR=/etc/suricata
SURICATA_RULES_SOURCES="all"
#SURICATA_RULES_SOURCES="et/open oisf/trafficid abuse.ch/sslbl-blacklist abuse.ch/sslbl-ja3 abuse.ch/feodotracker abuse.ch/urlhaus etnetera/aggressive tgreen/hunting stamus/lateral pawpatrules ptrules/open aleksibovellan/nmap"
```

> Note: You may need to change the size of the HEAP variables in the above configuration file based on your system requirements.  The settings present are for a machine with 8GB of memory

**Additionally, you must either clone this repository or download the entire repository in order to build and run these containers.**

### Keystore, Certificates and Users Credentials

Before we build or create our containers we first need to create our keystore, certificates and the users.  You can do this using the [docker-compose.setup.yml](docker-compose.setup.yml) yaml file.

To do so you simply run the following command first:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.setup.yml run --rm certs
```

## Running a development environment

Now, that you have your keys/certs and passwords set we can then just spin up the containers by running:

```
docker compose up -d
```

You should be able to login into the ELK stack with `SUPERUSER_USERNAME` user from your `.env` file.

## Handy commands

To remove all images from your system run: ```docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)```

To remove all volumes from your system run: ```docker volume prune```

## TODOs
1. Beats user has superuser access which needs to be downgraded (required for indexing and dashboard setup for now).
2. Suricata container is slow on startup due to rules update, it should be done less aggresively.
